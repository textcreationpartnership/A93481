            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This was Å¿igned by Sir <hi>John AÅ¿hby,</hi> Admiral of the Blew, Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval,</hi> Vice Admiral of the Red, Mr. <hi>Rook,</hi> Vice Admiral of the Blew, Sir <hi>ClouÅ¿ly Shouel,</hi> Rear Admiral of the Red, Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> Rear Admiral of the Blew; upon receiving which, her MajeÅ¿ty was pleaÅ¿ed to Å¿ay, <hi>That Å¿he had always this Opinion of the Commanders, but was glad this was come to Å¿atisfie others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The EngliÅ¿h and Dutch Fleets having now taken the Seas, on the 18th. of <hi>May,</hi> the Admirals Scouts, whilÅ¿t he bore South WeÅ¿t and by South, Å¿even Leagues from <hi>Cape Barfleur,</hi> made the Signal for Å¿eeing the Enemy, the Wind WeÅ¿twardly: The French bore down upon our Fleet, and about eleven engaged it, but at Å¿ome diÅ¿tance; we continued fighting till half an hour paÅ¿t five in the Evening, at which time, the Enemy tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with all their Boats, and we after them. It was calm all day, about Å¿ix there was a freÅ¿h Engagement to the WeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151734:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Admiral, Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be the Blew, and it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued calm all Night, but the Particulars at preÅ¿ent, are only, that the French were beaten, and the Admiral was Å¿teering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for <hi>Conquet Road,</hi> having a freÅ¿h Gale EaÅ¿terly (but very foggy) that being the place he Å¿uppoÅ¿ed they deÅ¿igned for; and that if it pleaÅ¿ed God to Å¿end Fair Weather, he doubted not but to deÅ¿troy the whole French Fleet. In the Night, three or four Ships were Å¿een to blow up, but not known what they were.</p>
            <p>As to Å¿ome other Particulars, it appears by another Advice, That about the grey or opening of the Morning, our Fleet made the <hi>French</hi> Fleet in a Line of Battel, about two Leagues to the Windward; and they then having the Weather-gage, bore down very boldly and cloÅ¿ely upon our Fleet; at Eleven the Engagement began, and continued very hot and furious till almoÅ¿t four in the Afternoon, at what time the <hi>French</hi> Fleet bore away. The Wind at WeÅ¿t by South, and WeÅ¿t South WeÅ¿t, veering about to North by EaÅ¿t, and North North EaÅ¿t, Sir <hi>ClouÅ¿ly Shouel,</hi> and Sir <hi>John AÅ¿hby,</hi> having the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, fell bravely on, maintaining the Engagement till almoÅ¿t ten at Night; the <hi>French</hi> all that while bearing away, and the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> purÅ¿uing them, Å¿ome Ships were Å¿een in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in flames, about nine of the Clock; but not knowing what they were, nor likewiÅ¿e the damage Å¿uÅ¿tained on either Å¿ide, when this Advice came away.</p>
            <p>But Å¿ince this, the <hi>Mary Galley</hi> came from Admiral <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿el,</hi> to <hi>Spithead;</hi> who left him at Eight in the morning, about fifteen Leagues South and by WeÅ¿t from the <hi>IÅ¿le of Wight,</hi> declaring he Å¿aw both the French Admirals Seconds Å¿unk, and many Ships on fire, and that for the Å¿pace of two Leagues together the Sea was full of Wrecks of Ships, but knew not of the loÅ¿s of any of their MajeÅ¿ties Ships or Commanders; and that when this Galley came away, the <hi>French</hi> were running, and the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> in purÅ¿uit of them; and about Ten of the Clock he heard them Engag'd again, and the Guns firing till One, at what time the Wind Å¿prung up at South and by WeÅ¿t.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:151734:4"/>
            <p>Upon this News, and ever to be wiÅ¿h'd-for SucceÅ¿s, as well by Land as Sea, of which Heaven has given us already Å¿o great an EarneÅ¿t of future Improvement againÅ¿t the Common Enemy, not only the Joy of all good Subjects abounded, but the Bells, in all places where it came, were rung out; the Tower-Guns, and thoÅ¿e in other places, were diÅ¿charged, and the Streets, at Night, filled with Bonfires and Illuminations, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and rejoycing of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Since the former Advices, a Letter came from <hi>PortÅ¿mouth,</hi> bearing date the 21Å¿t. of <hi>May,</hi> giving an Account that Their MajeÅ¿ties Ship the <hi>Montague,</hi> Captain <hi>Foulk</hi> Commander, came in thither from the Fleet, his Ship being diÅ¿abled in the Fight, he leaving the Fleet the day before, about Nine of the Clock in the morning, purÅ¿uing the Enemy; and Å¿ays, that Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> Reer-Admiral of the <hi>Blue,</hi> was kill'd in the Action. And the Å¿ame Letter further relates, That Captain <hi>KillingÅ¿worth,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Fox Fire-Å¿hip,</hi> had made his way to <hi>PortÅ¿mouth</hi> in his Boat; and gave an Account, That he had burnt his Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip on board the <hi>French</hi> Reer-Admiral, but was put off with a great deal of difficulty; and that he Å¿aw a <hi>French</hi> Man-of-War, of about Seventy Guns, blow up, and another Three-deck'd Ship on fire.</p>
            <p>On the Twenty firÅ¿t, about Nine of the Clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our Fleet Å¿et Å¿ail again; as likewiÅ¿e did the <hi>French:</hi> Admiral <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿el</hi> took his courÅ¿e towards <hi>Barfleur,</hi> having got Å¿ight of divers Ships under the Å¿hore: Admiral <hi>Allemond,</hi> of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Admiral of the <hi>Blue,</hi> Å¿ailed to the WeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e endeavoured to get up with Å¿ixteen of the Enemies Ships which he diÅ¿covered, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing them to be coming from <hi>France</hi> to joyn the French Fleet. Sir <hi>John AÅ¿hby</hi> purÅ¿ued the reÅ¿t of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, who in much ConfuÅ¿ion laboured to get into the Rafe of <hi>Ornay.</hi> Admiral <hi>Allemond</hi> loÅ¿t Å¿ight of the afore-mentioned Å¿ixteen Ships in the night, they having, as he Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, got in among the Rocks; and becauÅ¿e he found it not Å¿afe nor convenient to follow them there, he Å¿ailed EaÅ¿tward again, to rejoyn Admiral <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿el.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151734:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
